        <h1>Open Console</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is an IDE, similar to Brackets, but the layout is a little different. 
        It is made by Microsoft, and can be used on any device. You can download and install it 
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">at this link</a></p>
        <br><br>
        <p>The Console can be used to log information, as well as allow you to interact with a 
        web page by carrying out JavaScript expressions within the page’s context. The console allows 
        you to keep track of what is going on in your code. This makes it easy to figure out what’s 
        wrong in your code.
